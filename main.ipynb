    "We're given a pretty simple dataframe containing 2 columns, one containing a `url` which points to an image and the other containing a `caption` which describes the image. We want to calculate how similar the image is to the provided caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this a couple obvious but important insights are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to calculate the similarity between 2 inputs of different modalities (image-text).\n",
    "2. Our captions don't map to a set of predefined categories or labels E.g. [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"chair\", ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ This highlights that we require a model that is able to classify both images and text (image-text) along with supporting the classification of unseen labels (zero-shot classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive any deeper lets give a simple example of how we'd calculate the similarity between text to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how similar are `Unleash your Creativity`, `Bob Ross` and `42`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need is a model that is able to classify the semantic meaning of these pieces of text. These types of semantic classification or embedding models are widely available in todays rich pre-trained model ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feeding our text through on of these models (inference) we get back an embedding. This embedding is a point in a high-dimensional vector space which encodes or represents the semantic meaning of the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./assets/text-embedding.png\" width=\"720\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing this process with our example pieces of text each piece of text gets a point in this vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./assets/multiple-text-embeddings.png\" width=\"720\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The closeness of these points indicates their relatedness or similarity. This closeness or distance is easily measured (with measures like euclidean distance, cosine distance etc) as our embeddings are just points in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ This distance measurement is our similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Images to Text\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes our problem slightly different to the above is instead of comparing text to text we're comparing images to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully the only thing that changes is the model we are required to use to produce our classification. This model needs to be multimodal and needs to output an embedding for both images and text in the same vector space. Once we have this key piece calculating the similarity is conceptually the same as the text to text example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./assets/image-text-embedding.png\" width=\"720\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ Ta-da! We now have a blueprint to conceptually calculate the similarity of an image and a piece of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Unseen Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned looking at our data reveals a wide variety of various captions and images. This freeform nature can be an issue for some models, especially if the model hasn't been trained (previously seen) on a particular label.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had a model that was only trained on images of fruit and we gave it an image of a sports car things would go south pretty quick. Therefore we need a model that's able to handle this level of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task however we don't need too go too deep on this topic, but more understand that this directly influences our model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically we require a [Zero-shot Image Classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-image-classification) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "So we know we require a `Zero-shot Image Classification` model, and as previously mentioned there are a bunch of high-quality pre-trained models available for us to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the interim conversations I've had with the team at ðŸ§™ Leonardo.ai I understand that [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a popular choice to use these pre-trained foundational models. So that sounds like a good place to start to me!\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the Zero-shot Image Classification models available a couple popular choices standout.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI's CLIP-vit models (a couple size and fine-tuned variations)\n",
    "- Meta's Metaclip models (again with a couple size and fine-tuned variations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world scenario we'd want to spend a fair amount of time comparing the performance aspects of these models and how that suits our problem requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we'll go with one of OpenAI's smaller sized variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so now we understand how to calculate the similarity of an image and a piece of text and we have a model in mind lets talk about implementation!\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a big fan of the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles, but I'm also very aware of not trying to \"boiling the ocean\" (over-engineering) for this particular challenge - often times I find keeping things simple goes a very long way.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, I'll aim for an implementation that enables easy experimentation and support for various components (models, distance calculations etc). This is something that is particularly important in todays rapidly evolving ecosystem."
